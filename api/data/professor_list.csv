His lectures are dry, the course homework doesn't prepare you much for the exams, and the exams are brutal with targeted 50% medians. During the Chegg scandals, he did nothing to find cheaters and instead canceled the final exam. I'm so lucky I got to take it S/U."
Social Science,298,Cornell University,Dorit,,Abusch,277351,11,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.0,4.0,4.0,LING4425,"Most unpleasant professor I've had. She provided no avenues through which to help her students (never responded to emails, prohibited student collaboration, no TA, no office hours), and she talked down to students who asked questions. Frequently singled out students in class with no clear intention but to say what they had done wrong. Unacceptable."

Super enthusiastic about what he is teaching, always encourages questions. He really makes everyone feel really positive about coming to his class.

African Studies,298,Cornell University,Gerard,,Aching,2770742,1,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.0,4.0,4.0,ARSC3010,"He is a solid professor overall and likes to answer questions. He does not give rubrics for his few graded assignments. I found that he contradicted himself sometimes ideologically and seemed to respect his own ideas more than students' or just had a hard time relating. He says he is understanding but also puts you off a bit too, so tread lightly."

Hotel & Restaurant Management,298,Cornell University,Aaron,,Adalja,2350519,13,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.6,5.0,5.0,HADM1360,Professor Adalja was my most caring and friendly professor this semester. He grades very fairly and is always approachable. His TA's are very helpful and he frequently holds office hours. There are many grades in the class but as long as you stay ahead and pay attention you will do fine. I liked that he lets you see what you missed on exams too.

He is EXTREMELY disorganized which makes the course much more stressful, but he ultimately gives everyone a good grade (A- or above), unless you are really bad then maybe he'll give you a B+. Much less work than other language classes. He acts a lot and is fun also!"
Law,298,Cornell University,Lee,,Adler,533286,10,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.3,4.0,4.0,ILRLR3045,"Great professor and interesting topic, but class is unorganized. Readings and assignments are sent in long/confusing email chains. Otherwise, Prof is very knowledgeable and shares many personal stories about the topic of the day.

He isn't helpful outside of class, and assigns labs and homeworks that take upwards of 10 hours to complete, every week. He is great in lecture, but makes the class unbearable. "
Human Ecology,298,Cornell University,Jennifer,,Agans,2349331,8,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,1.2,,,HD1170,"She made it really hard to enjoy the class, since she either moved through the material too quickly, or brought in guest lecturers who didn't know what they were doing either.

The prelims are a bit knit-picky and the online textbook can be a bit boring but I would otherwise totally recommend this Intro. to Bio course for non-majors. The lectures were the most dynamic ones I've seen considering the size of the class."

Sociology,298,Cornell University,Steven,Elias,Alvarado,2576930,1,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.0,,,PAM2208,"Lectures are basically reading over the slides and does not communicate information effectively or in a logical manner.

The problem sets were long (2-8 hours each week) and the exams were fair. The problem sets were graded very harshly and were worth 40% of the overall grade, so spending a lot of time on them was definitely worth it. I honestly wasn't expecting to like PChem so much!"

Bad jokes and excessive cold calling make it painful to sit through. Three problem sets are due each week which get repetitive. His homework and practice problems (even exams) are riddled with errors which makes it hard to prepare for exams. Exam questions are always random and the multiple choice is so hard.

Would have been nice if he gave more difficult homework to better prepare us for the test. Practice test useless for actual test prep.

High amounts of papers to read that are 5 years old and ancient in the field added on. Only plus is she gives out prelim questions before the exam and you can drop a prelim (out of 3). Lectures are decent and relevant to the week's paper.

She treats students like they have no knowledge of basic biology or genetics. All you have to do is show up and look through your notes the night before prelims to get an A. 1 short paper and an easy take-home final. Worth taking for the interesting articles and easy GPA booster.

She makes the class much easier to understand, trying her best to deconstruct everything. She even makes funny jokes along the way. Truly, I have much respect for her, simply put."

Science,298,Cornell University,Dennis,,Zhou,1524233,3,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.7,4.5,4.5,PHYSI1112,"He's not a professor, he only does recitation. He's pretty good though. he sometimes goes too fast, but I liked him this semester. Very chill guy / decent teacher."
Mathematics,298,Cornell University,Xin,,Zhou,2736887,1,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.0,,,MATH4130,"This class doesn't deserve the difficulty of an ""Honors"" class. We are entirely following the textbook, which is very easy, and nothing covered in the class went beyond the a regular mathematical analysis class. The professor is nice and teaches well, though. I just worry that this class is too easy."
Economics,298,Cornell University,Tao,,Zhu,194368,26,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.0,4.0,4.0,ECON3140,"Very difficult to understand. Lectures were dry, boring, and scatterbrained. I fell asleep almost every lecture that I went to. If you read the book though and go to Section, you can easily get an A like I did. Just pray for a good TA."
Engineering,298,Cornell University,Roseanna,,Zia,1795003,6,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.6,5.0,5.0,CHEME3230,"Zia is one of the best professors I've ever had at Cornell. Her lectures were clear, easy to follow, and helped with the homework and exams. She was helpful outside of class and provided fun and useful extra credit activities. She really wanted to make sure we learned the material and enjoyed joying so."
Human Ecology,298,Cornell University,Nicolas,,Ziebarth,2000986,3,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.2,5.0,5.0,PAM2350,"He is a great teacher! His lectures are engaging, and you can tell he is really passionate about the subject. The exams are fair, and the exams are based solely on lectures! The class isn't curved, but there are a couple extra credit opportunities. I would def take a class with him again. If you work hard and study, you'll get the grade u want."

Political Science,298,Cornell University,Hubert,,Zimmerman,629356,6,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.2,4.0,4.0,AA035432,He was not lecturing a lot. We had to do all the work. It was hard to understand what he preferes. He doesnt grade well.
Sociology,298,Cornell University,John,,Zinda,2379558,4,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,1.8,4.0,4.0,DSOC3240,I've never had a professor before who doesn't know his own material. He literally reads from a script in class and cannot teach without it. It's very unprofessional and makes it hard to understand what he's talking about because he's essentially reading an essay out loud.
Biology,298,Cornell University,Stephen,,Zinder,1989775,2,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.2,4.5,4.5,BIOMI2900,"Horrible lecturer. Was little to no help in office hours. Microbio was taught along with Professor Winans, who was MUCH better. Zinder couldn't explain the material and made exam questions extremely specific. Take this class with another prof"

Labor & Employment Relations,298,Cornell University,Emily,,Zitek,1903952,10,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.1,4.0,4.0,ILROB3760,"Taken online. This class is very chill especially if you like sports. There isn't much work and the tests are easy. You don't need to read the textbook, the tests are based on the slides. There are also cool guest speakers. I would recommend this class."
Government,298,Cornell University,Thomas,,Zittel,1403262,1,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.0,,,GOVT3437,"Relatively easy class.  Not always the most easy to understand what would be on the exam, but in the end his powerpoints were very helpful, moreso than the books.  Lecture is important since he adds much to the slides.  His German accent is easy to understand and he often makes fun of the French."
Architecture,298,Cornell University,Sasa,,Zivkovic,2384073,2,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.5,4.0,4.0,ARCH1101,Put so much into this class to receive only a B- I did what I was told and made changes to assignments to the professors liking and still had trouble. The professors were barely around in the class compared to the TAs.

It is definitely a challenging class, but he is so passionate about the content that it was so enjoyable. If you take diligent notes and memorize the slide IDs for the exams it won't be too difficult. 10/10 would recommend."
English,298,Cornell University,Brad,,Zukovic,2090822,1,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.0,4.0,4.0,WRIT1370,"If you just wanna gain a S grade in FWS , this course is your best choice. Pro. Brad put the whole grading and workload pretty little and the estimated time spending per week is 5 hrs or less. But he is willing to listen to your advice and if you want to dive in deep topics, you can still talk with him in person."
Mathematics,298,Cornell University,David,,Zywina,2171095,11,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.6,5.0,5.0,MATH1120,"Professor Zywina backs up each new theorem and concept with varied and relevant examples. He can go off on tangents when proving theorems but if you lose focus its fine as he specifies what is ""extra information"". Tests are clear and fair but they do require thorough understanding of concepts. Patient and accessible outside of class as well."
