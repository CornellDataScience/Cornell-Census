Mathematics,298,Cornell University,Salam,,Abdus,1053274,10,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.5,4.5,4.5,,"Worst Professor ever, but it was they easiest class at Cornell","He is incredibly boring lecture. Lectures straight from the text so it is a waste of time to go to lecture. Weekly problem sets are simply if you are decent at math & read and/or go to class. Prelims are about the same difficulty. Overall, I would not recommend taking this course with him, esp. if you are not good at math.",just read the textbook. lecture is useless unless you need to hear things out loud. extremely boring.

Very clear in teaching and econ experiments and  practices in his class are generally fun and helpful for learning the material. He is very responsive to students as well, analyzing every student's test result dealing with problems individually. Exams are OKAY but you got to study. I recommend taking his intro class.",not bad but you gotta study like crazy
Chemistry,298,Cornell University,Hector,,Abruna,179459,35,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.1,,,,"Abru\xc3\xb1a clearly isn't all that interested in teaching at this point in his career. His lectures are dry, the course homework doesn't prepare you much for the exams, and the exams are brutal with targeted 50% medians. During the Chegg scandals, he did nothing to find cheaters and instead canceled the final exam. I'm so lucky I got to take it S/U.","Brutal class. Barely teaches and loves to ramble. Read your textbook, redo sapling problems, and go to Cara's problem solving sessions - all infinitely more helpful than he was. I skipped lecture but be warned 10% of tests is stuff from lecture. Speaking of tests, impossibly difficult. Too many hard questions with not enough time. Averages are 50%",By far the hardest class Ive ever taken. I only got a B+ in this class because I sacrificed all of my time for working out and going out to study for chem. The mean was around 50% on both prelims. Hector ridiculed students for not knowing answers in lecture. Even worse is that the class was 75% AP Chem students who already learned the material
Social Science,298,Cornell University,Dorit,,Abusch,277351,11,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.0,4.0,4.0,,"Most unpleasant professor I've had. She provided no avenues through which to help her students (never responded to emails, prohibited student collaboration, no TA, no office hours), and she talked down to students who asked questions. Frequently singled out students in class with no clear intention but to say what they had done wrong. Unacceptable.","Class time was used to read aloud the readings that were assigned for homework. She is generally presents material in an unclear and inefficient manner, and sets very unclear expectations for papers. She also only likes essays if they are super basic, clear, and elementary, and is very inconsistent. Generally, very confusing and frustrating class.",The professor is generally rude and unpleasant. I would not recommend this class if you are a person who is easily offended or discouraged. The only decent thing is her feedback which goes a bit in depth. However she will call you to read out loud and will scold you for the most basic things.

Super enthusiastic about what he is teaching, always encourages questions. He really makes everyone feel really positive about coming to his class. His lectures are AMAZING, but somehow he always apologizes. \n\nMy absolute favorite professor (+most humorous professor) at Cornell!",Love this professor! Absolutely my favorite class at Cornell since 4 years ago. The professor is very inspirational and he really wants to help you learn. Highly recommend his class,The course is theoretical but inspiring. It seems he has spent a lot of time on the course materials. You will definitely learn a lot if you put enough time on it.
African Studies,298,Cornell University,Gerard,,Aching,2770742,1,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.0,5.0,5.0,,"He has a reputation for not caring about classes since he's near retirement, and can be a bit ethereal and touchy as someone else mentioned. He's really brilliant, but during the pandemic kind of lectured about something off topic. Kind of moody, and maybe even rude at times","Professor Aching is awesome! He is extremely intelligent and knowledgable of the subject he is teaching while simultaneously open to hearing and understanding the opinions of others. He is also really understanding when it comes to extensions, missing class, etc. Grading is a bit tough but you get used to it and there's not that much work.","He is a solid professor overall and likes to answer questions. He does not give rubrics for his few graded assignments. I found that he contradicted himself sometimes ideologically and seemed to respect his own ideas more than students' or just had a hard time relating. He says he is understanding but also puts you off a bit too, so tread lightly."

His slides tend to have a lot of information and the test questions tend to be very specific, so taking good notes and studying throughout the class will help you a lot.",Professor Adalja was my most caring and friendly professor this semester. He grades very fairly and is always approachable. His TA's are very helpful and he frequently holds office hours. There are many grades in the class but as long as you stay ahead and pay attention you will do fine. I liked that he lets you see what you missed on exams too.,"Great Professor. I think a lot of the reviews here was when he was new to teaching, and the course was fluid. Now that he has experience teaching, the course is awesome. Learned a lot and actually enjoyed showing up to class, even though I am not interested in F&B as a career. Lectures were interesting and lively, and the coursework/exams were easy"

She guarantees a B in this FWS as long as you do all your work, she only gives A's to those she deems have done ""superior work"". Overall, interesting topic, seminar can be dry at times","Fortunate enough to have taken two separate courses (3210 + senior seminar) with her. Engaging presentation of material. Possesses an amazing ability to draw even the most timid students into class discussions by relating their comments to the discussion, thus encouraging participation--I sometimes enjoyed just sitting back and watching her teach!","Prof. Adelson is always super prepared, poised and incredibly receptive to student comments. She is totally brilliant but makes you feel like it was you who was coming up with all the great ideas. I learned a ton!"

He is EXTREMELY disorganized which makes the course much more stressful, but he ultimately gives everyone a good grade (A- or above), unless you are really bad then maybe he'll give you a B+. Much less work than other language classes. He acts a lot and is fun also!","He's a good professor, his grading is haphazard though and there's more emphasis on speaking the language than actual tests",I really enjoyed this class! ADEMOYO IS A GREAT PROFESSOR! He aims to have his students learn the material but does not overwhelm them. The class is totally manageable and the professor is extremely helpful. Best language class I've EVER taken :)
Law,298,Cornell University,Lee,,Adler,533286,10,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.3,4.0,4.0,,"Great professor and interesting topic, but class is unorganized. Readings and assignments are sent in long/confusing email chains. Otherwise, Prof is very knowledgeable and shares many personal stories about the topic of the day. Lots of reading, but no need to do it all. Participation/attendance and a final paper are all that grades are based on.",Prof. Adler is one of the best professors in all of ILR. He has amazing experiences to tell and truly cares about his students and the material he teaches. He may go off-topic a fair amount but only because of his enormous breadth of knowledge in literally every topic imaginable.,"Professor Adler really cares about his students and caters his lectures to the class. Most of the work is reading court cases and then discussing them in class. His papers are tough, but you will learn a lot in his class."

He makes his lectures personal enough to intrigue the class, but doesn't make the class about him and talks about Chinese history in the context of the present day and the world. Content is extremely clear and absolutely interesting!",I've taken 3 of his classes and always love him! He knows what he is talking about and cares about how you are doing. He's accessible and takes his students' work seriously. Readings can be a lot sometimes but you can manage to get away. He's also very hilarious. Recommend to anyone interested in China.,His office hours are very helpful. Hands down one of the best professors at Cornell.
Engineering,298,Cornell University,Ehsan,,Afshari,972858,6,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.8,5.0,5.0,,"Ehsan seems really smart, but he is the worst kind of professor to have. He isn't helpful outside of class, and assigns labs and homeworks that take upwards of 10 hours to complete, every week. He is great in lecture, but makes the class unbearable. ","This guy is smart, but teaches stuff wayyyy too fast, and gives homework way harder than anything we've done in class. If you have the time to read the book for hours on end outside of class, then this guy is great, but with the assumption we all have other things to do, this class was way too difficult.",He taught the course really well
Human Ecology,298,Cornell University,Jennifer,,Agans,2349331,8,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,1.2,,,,"She made it really hard to enjoy the class, since she either moved through the material too quickly, or brought in guest lecturers who didn't know what they were doing either. That being said, this class is not difficult if you do the readings in the textbook and look through and memorize notes before exams.","wow. just. wow. she managed to make the final exam nearly impossible to study for, and put the most random questions on the test. truly, no words to describe how disappointed I am with this class.","Absolutely wack. Is VERY rude to students when they ask questions, ask her to slow down, or question her data. Treats students like children (i.e. clapping to get attention) and somehow manages to make a relevant topic very boring. She also makes it difficult to study; lecture slides are not posted, class moves quickly, little guidance."

But... in lecture, he came across kind of snarky. Curses a lot. But simultaneously demands a lot of respect. Explains things relatively well. Almost all homeworks are required to be done in groups (of 3+, I think?). Which is actually nice, in a way. ",Loved him while taking OS. Really cared about students' learning and their experience.,"I took this class and dropped it half way. The material is interesting but he's a nightmare to deal with. Every problem in the class was always someone else's fault, never his. Seems pretty full of himself. Won't be taking a class he teaches again."

The prelims are a bit knit-picky and the online textbook can be a bit boring but I would otherwise totally recommend this Intro. to Bio course for non-majors. The lectures were the most dynamic ones I've seen considering the size of the class.","I liked this class a lot, and Professor Agrawal was such a great professor!

Questions are always welcome and help is available almost whenever. Much-appreciated accommodations were made during covid19.,Aguiar was so lovely. He encourages students to ask questions and tries to link the class to real-world examples. He has a good grasp of how much students can viably absorb in one class and usually doesn't try to overstuff the class.

Write a few notes but really just absorb the content. Most importantly DO THE READINGS!!!! If you go to class, participate and do the readings this will be the most fun and amazing class. A class with Professor Ahl is an experience no one should pass up!","The most fascinating and engaging lecturer I've had at Cornell, and in my top 2 or three all time (I have a BA elsewhere).  Like another reviewer said, sometimes you just put the pen down and listen. Assigned very creative and effective essay prompts, one of which I now use as a writing teacher. Opinionated for sure.

Very accessible and we had individual meeting sign ups with her for our papers too which shows she cared. I'm not particularly interested in anthropology but the material for Time Travel was pretty interesting.,Had her for a FWS on time travel. The nature of the class meant it was really reading heavy but they were all interesting and nothing felt like busy work. She took the time to get to know her students and clearly cared about our wellbeing. I would reccomend

Taken for ILR soph writing requirement. Prof is nice and pretty knowledgable about her topics. She struggles to communicate how to do assignments and when they are due but doesn't grade harshly. You may have to ask her multiple times. Not too much work and it isn't too difficult or tedious. I think participation matters.,"Prof. Ajunwa has been my favorite professor at ILR to date. Shes a knowledge powerhouse and was terrific at teaching labor law in a way that would benefit non-lawyers. During the pandemic she was also very flexible with students, which is a true gem regardless. Dont miss a class with her if you can help it!"

Group quizzes on every other session on average. Prelims and exams are fair. Practice with HW and previous prelims for the numerical part. True or False questions separate the A students from the herd so make sure to understand the concepts fully.,Terry is an amazing professor for a rather difficult class as I didn't come in with a good micro/macro foundation. He is great at explaining concepts and was also caring during this hectic semester (made prelim 2 optional and bought us all ice cream). Beware of his pop quizzes in class though.,"Terry teaches the class material well. The issue is not with him but rather with the class setup.

","Dr. Allen is very charismatic and a favorite in the animal science department, evidently.

If you follow what happens in congress at all, you'll find his lectures engaging. Midterm and final were easy and the one paper was manageable. Expect to learn a lot without too much work. 10/10 would recommend!","Professor Bateman's lectures were very animated and engaging. Unfortunately, classes moved online and the aspect of asking questions and engaging with his students in a lecture were no longer possible.

Certain parts of the Descartes text were interesting, but after a while the class got repetitive and boring. He is a fair grader and wants to help those in his class. Very approachable. Just watch out for being bored to tears by the seminar and the reading (even though its short). Overall, so-so.","Good professor... very interesting class. He grades very hard though.

She's not looking to screw anyone over in terms of grades and her tests are pretty fair. Projects were interesting applications of the material but often took way too much time to complete.,"Lecture has proven to be useless, so is the discussion. Course is challenging in the sense that the homework does not prepare you for the exam. Projects are meaningless and time consuming. Highly recommend using Course Hero to redo the old prelims.

Sheila is nice, and she tries to make the class as personal as possible, but she thought we all got a more concrete understanding of the material than we actually did. Quizzes were poorly designed; grading was arbitrary. Creative projects and guest lectures were great though.","This class is about bs-ing as much as possible. THe assignments are vague & arbitrary. Sheila admitted to my face that she doesn't even factor in the extra credit (which takes HOURS) into your grade, so don't even bother doing it.

One of the best professors I've had.","I found Prof Davis to be a good lecturer.  While he does deeply care for the subject, he does not seem to be as interested in the class itself.

His organization does need improvement...","Professor Davis was a new professor Fall 2021. I'm sure he'll get better at teaching. His biggest issues definitely stemmed from a lack of organization.

Class isn't too hard if you keep up, and exams just require you to regurgitate material.","Easy to get a good grade in this class, but you have to read (or at least skim) each of the 5-6 articles that she assigns per week. Besides that, she focused too much on specific regions of the world (e.g. Brazil and Papua New Guinea), which was annoying because I was excited to learn about cuisine from ALL over the world.","God, I don't even know where to begin.  If you can, avoid this women.  The class material would be so much more interesting if a blind and deaf toddler taught it.  The grading is pretty easy, but seriously, I'm pretty sure she makes up 80% of the lecture material, the other 20% coming right from the ridiculous long textbook readings."

I did both a class and an independent study with him and he opened my eyes to a new world of history. I finally felt like I was being understood, I am forever grateful. His class was fun and interesting and as long as you cared you are going to get a good grade.","Very much a mixed bag. Assigns lots of reading but guides discussion of it very well, good at pushing a free conversation among students to useful places. Unfortunately he also gives maddeningly cryptic responses to even the most straightforward questions, especially about assignments and grading. Grading and comments are mostly unclear/unhelpful."

You can also put in a modest effort and spend a lot of time on the two assignments, and still manage a good grade. Very smart guy.","The professor is very nice and you can tell he truly loves teaching, so it's hard to complain because he definitely cares about his students. That said, this class was very disorganized. He would hop from one topic to the next and since he never used the textbook, I never knew how and where to study from.

A lot of classes are him talking at you for an hour. The classes with discussions are far more interesting, but far more sparse. He will not give you a grade until the very end of the semester so it is difficult to gage where you are.","He is one of the most frustrating professors I have ever had. He loves to listen to himself talk, and that is basically all that happens for 2/3 of class. We are currently writing 4 essays simultaneously, and none of them have due dates, essentially meaning we have 4 essays due finals week. He ignores any part of a text that references anything"

Sociology,298,Cornell University,Shelley,,Feldman,224516,8,poor,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,1.6,4.5,4.5,,"Shelley Feldman's approach reflects a dangerous trend in academia. She is a postmodernist ideologue for whom there is no objective truth, except for hers of course. For her science is a tool that allows western white males to maintain power. This is what happens when you're so open minded your brain falls out. She is not a teacher, she is a bully.","Absolutely terrible class. Shelley is dithering postmodern fool who will fail you if you point out the depth of her intellectual dishonesty. She teaches in a social science department but has a problem with science.

He wrote the textbook, so expect to read a lot. Prelim questions are so specific, which is not ideal for an introductory course.

Lectures can be dry but as long as you read the book you will be fine. Dr. Hammer give good help in OH too.,"Lectures from the assumption that students know about/have prior interest in fusion, so he sometimes speaks aimlessly, assuming students know what he's talking about. But, he was very helpful in office hours and provided lots of advice on the major project (""designing"" a nuclear reactor). HW was vital to clarifying the actual course expectations.","Hammer is an amazing lecturer, being clear, informative, and engaging. He is approachable, friendly, and very knowledgeable. The material for fusion is difficult, like Physics 2214 on crack.  Fusion weekly HW takes 4-7 hours.  Do well on the final project!   Expect B+/A- median grades for Fusion and a free A for attendance for Energy Seminar."

He doesn't seem to know or care at all about what the difference between Decadence and Aestheticism is. He seems to have never grown out of the bad habit of trying to assimilate the authors one admires. Be yourself! And stop playing long videos in class!","He has an ego but his teaching is mediocre at best. He may be a first-rate intellectual, but his contemptuous indolence is tiresome.

I highly recommend taking one of his classes if you would like to see every step worked out and a little (OK, a lot of) humor along the way.

Very engaging in class too!,The lectures may at times seem complex but they are meant to be accompanied with the textbook. As long as you keep up on your reading the tests should be fine. The quizzes are literally from the homework. Don't really understand why so many people are complaining about the class when it's pretty straightforward.,Awful Professor. Worst in all 4 years. Terrible lecturer and never clarifies his slides even when a student is confused. Students are always wrong on the polling questions.

As long as you're keeping up with the readings and show up to class, you'll have a good time in the course.",Took both of his classes - Competition Law and Economics and the Law. Highly recommended - one the best professors and leans more on the law side than Econ and incredibly knowledgeable with a fantastic experience.

This course is pretty dry with some interesting topics towards the end of the semester.  Professor Herter's prelims and final are not hard as long as you do the practice tests and memorize stuff from lecture slides.  Easy class but very very dry.,"He basically reads off the slides, and I find the lectures pretty useless as all the slide are online. The discussions are a lot more helpful. He's the kind of professor you want to like, and he tries to keep things interesting with demos and things, but he goes off on a lot of boring tangents and gives too many pointless examples and slideshows."

She breezes through topics that the 2220 class goes in depth into, and uses that knowledge as an assumed baseline. A very concept-based non-memorization class. One of the best classes I've taken at Cornell.","Obviously a very intelligent person but very bad at conveying information. Assumes too much, diagrams are confusing and lectures are hard to follow. She goes through things really fast and especially if you don't have background in the material, it gets frustrating. Should not be an intro class at least. Nice woman, terrible teacher.",Really interesting class if you don't mind math or chugging through journal articles once in a while.  Professor Linster did a great job keeping people interested and has a fun classroom style.    Take the readings seriously.

Homework was very straightforward, especially if BEE 2510 was previously taken. Exams were very similar to the practice ones he gives out.","He does weekly quizzes so that everyone stays on top of the material. He also does makes sure everyone has notes to take. His notes are not available outside of class which forces us to go to class. Very helpful, very friendly!",I loved the actual class but the professor didn't really listen to his students or offer a lot of help to students in need. He wasn't willing to go the extra mile to help. I don't recommend him.

And the people who say that sit on the back and don't even listen to the lectures. They only think lectures are helpful if they help you increase your grade. Well. the lectures are not helpful that way but it is very fruitful if you're going to be a meche.,"Before the class I had high expectation of both him and the subject (AI). However, after it I was disappointed about both. He has a weak understanding of the theories underlying the subject, and hence was unable to give helpful expositions. His ability of creating hypes and projecting confidence seemed to conceal much of the weakness - deplorable.","Nice guy, appears to like what he teaches, although seems one of those professors that would rather be doing research or something else. Lectures are somewhat irrelevent to the course focus (labs) and aren't really worth going to. Takes attendance by doing handed-in class exercises, but doesn't seem to affect the grade. Fun, challenging course."

Not recommended for people looking for an easy pass; you have to try. Worth it if you do.","This class was absolutely amazing. Chris is actually the coolest person I've ever met. He was an archery instructor, bartender, and he runs a nonprofit on the side. nbd... but i have absolutely NO clue what grade i'm gonna get in his class.","worst class ever. I hate this dude. yeah he's funny, but god he's such a tool. and unorganized. unless you're absolutely amazing at writing poetry and stories, get ready to get destroyed by him. not recommended for people like me who were just taking it for fun. sucked the life out of me."

But I'd definitely recommend her classes","Intro to German is a difficult class no matter how you spin it, Professor Lischke does a very good job at engaging students and making content digestible. That being said, your success is hinged upon getting a good TA, which I did not. The majority of learning is done outside of class and without a solid TA to reinforce concepts, its a nightmare."

There are TA's, but they move their office hours every single week so it's inconsistent. Take this class or this teacher if you want a headache.","Lots of structure, lots of redundant work. Its a tough course but you learn a lot. Jack has little patience, but hes a nice guy and wants you to do well. There are some minor issues with materials, but far less than in past years it would seem. This is dependent on TAs.

Im extremely grateful to have professors like him still at Cornell, as they are a dying breed.","Worst class I've ever taken. Prof tries to pass humor off as ""dry"" but just comes off rude and arrogant. Case studies are difficult and take days to complete; he doesn't lecture on the material needed until AFTER they are due.

Most of the grade was based on group case-studies and an exam based on the topics covered in the case studies (easy). Super helpful and approachable.

Would definitely take another class with him","Great material, inconsistent lecturer. Some days are better than others, but the really bad days make you feel like a captive audience.

Russ' lectures are hilarious, and he gives you a great impression of what it's like to be a statistician in the real world. Office hours were really helpful.",The course itself is fine but it was taught in such an unorganized way that the material seemed harder than it really way. Those who did well attended multiple TA hours to get help on the problem sets. He also did not follow syllabus. I would not recommend taking any course with him.,"As a stats major, this man is the worst stats professor I've ever had. He posts no lectures online and often gets sassy with students when they ask for help. He goes on random rants about his life in the middle of class and awkwardly calls on people for no reason. Avoid this class."

Lloyd is helpful in class, although difficult to reach outside of it. The class consisted of 8 projects that ranged from the very easy (apply to research programs online) to finding exoplanets and other difficult tasks. You need Python experience.","If you have any interest in astronomy, this class is an easy way to satisfy distribution requirements.  Lloyd is a good teacher and he cares about teaching astronomy but a lot of the students don't show any interest in the class and just want an easy A, so some of the students complain about it, but all you need to do is just do the work.","Lloyd's lectures are mostly good.  He does lots of demos that are really entertaining.  The class is pretty easy, but there are homeworks and you need to study for the exams."

She clearly understands that there are students in a single class that are coming at the language at many different levels. Beware though: the required ""course pack"" of textbooks, CDs, and leaflets is not useful at all, and will likely run you $200 for materials you do not need. Buy the main two books and the online code only.",Grammar grammar grammar Grammar grammar,Well organized class. She really cares about students' improvement and is truly dedicated to teaching.

Means well but gives harsh criticism and seems to have trouble understanding other people's artistic perspectives that differ from hers.","I was so excited to take this class when I enrolled, but it's been the most stressful class of my semester. Rather than taking a smaller amount quality pictures, students are forced to take hundreds of pictures within short time constraints for critique.

No need to buy the text.",Dr. Loew is my favorite professor so far at Cornell. He is very interested in the topic he's teaching and tells some hilarious stories. Make sure you go to lecture! He goes through the slides very quickly and puts very few words on them. If you aren't in class you will have no idea what it was about. Go to office hours and ask questions.

Unfortunately, he will not be teaching next semester because he is being appointed the head of the IR minor.  He is a real softy at heart. Questions are on readings and films, probably doesn't give below a B, and gives extra credit through optional sections.","Fantastic, in depth, knowledgeable lecturer. Really knows a lot about foreign policy esp Vietnam (his book won the Pulitzer). Optional discussion section for extra points. Lots of paperback reading that isn't really required until the prelim/final, where it plays a heavy part. Takes lots of questions in class.

His class was well taught, and he spent hours preparing all of the pre-lecture videos for us to watch. He is very approachable and engaged us during lecture.",It was a pretty heavy workload. Mueller participated in flipped class where we had the lecture recorded before class and then in person was problem solving to practice concepts. We were allowed to bring in 5 pages of notes for each prelim which was helpful since we could write down anything we wanted on it. If you put in the work you'll be fine.,Had a great introductory physics course experience with Prof. Mueller. There was plenty of practice questions and office hours with the teaching staff available to help with the material. Tried his best to make accommodations as needed for the class and appreciated his effort to run the class as smoothly as possible.

As usual, Sreematidi was very helpful and enthusiastic. Since there were only 2 students in the class, she worked class times and office hours around our schedules.

Very quiet and somewhat neurotic with his notes.  Speaks a little too softly, but is interested in his coursework and his students.  Could be somewhat more exciting, though.  Readings are excellent.  Major complaint is the promise of discussions of texts in class, but we never get to say anything.","Most well-prepared professor I've ever had--borderline OCD. Najemy's not interested in big picture ideas or daring interpretations.

Thank you Prof. Ong.,"I've been waiting 2 yrs to take this class and looked forward to it after reading the comments. He is sometimes late and often has trouble working the audio visual system in the room. However, several of his lectures really hit home for me and made me reconsider my premed major. Take this class before you graduate!","He was a great professor, easy readings, the papers were good, very interesting class. You can get an A there are 3 prelims a final and 2 papers which are about urself, take the class its worth it"

Prof. Ophir is hilarious and probably the best professor I've had. The class isn't stressful at all because it's broken up into small assignments like quizzes that are graded fairly.","He's a nice guy and willing to help students, although his lectures are sometimes a little bit confusing because he over-explains simple concepts. Prelims are LONG & sometimes graded unfairly, but pretty easy. Make sure to know ALL the key terms he hands out. Lowest prelim dropped, poster presentation is an easy 95-97% and counts as an exam grade",

Try to avoid her.,

This professor is a tough grader, but she is a very sharp, critical reader. She will tear your essay apart, but if you're willing, you will learn so much about expository writing, and how to craft watertight arguments. The essays aren't easy, but you will stretch your critical thinking and writing skills.","She just likes to shut people down in class, prob one of her main hobbies. She's stern and mean, but she does have a sense of humor deep down. She is a hard essay grader, like ugh. We do 8 essays over the semester, and the eight one is due a month before finals (which im not sure is allowed), but she also extorted $22 from each of us...","She provided a ton of helpful criticism, and once I got over her tearing my papers apart my writing improved markedly."

There were prelims that were memorization heavy and two essays that were graded generously, along with a completion paper that was easy. The discussion sections were interesting and I liked the discussion that was had.",Dr. Overby is by far one of the greatest professors at Cornell. She is incredibly educated and uses her knowledge to teach her students about the real world and values the importance of class discussions. She never cuts students off and makes everyone feel respected. 100/10 would recommend any of her classes.,"Kim Overby has been my favorite professor at Cornell by far. Her lectures are interesting and applicable to anyone who is striving for a career in healthcare. As an MD and a clinical ethicist, she is incredibly knowledgable and frequently talks about real cases she encountered when she was practicing. Median grade for 2051 was an A in Fall 2019."

As other reviewers have mentioned, he genuinely cares about his students and works hard to create a friendly classroom environment. His Arabic class was the best hour of my day, because he strongly encourages students to work together outside class. Also, he has a great sense of humor.","Kadhim is a really nice teacher and made every day pretty fun with his personality. Also, he encouraged a sense of friendship within the classroom which made it easier to study outside of class.

His goal is to make you use critical thinking to answer questions, but in the end his teaching style means that you don't end up learning much about biology.

The class also has a harsh curve, all tests are T/F.","""My thinking questions are the type of evaluations you can expect on the MCAT"". No Prof Owens, Ive taken the MCAT and can attest that memorization is far more valued than your method of TF grading which serves to primarily induce stress, confusion, and skewed expectations for premeds. Still must admit, he is very commited to teaching vital concepts","Here's the deal: If you're the type of person who has gotten by so far in life by memorizing text books then this class isn't for you. Ownens asks questions that require you to have a deep understanding of the material beyond the simple facts. They are difficult, but fair. "
Human Ecology,298,Cornell University,Emily,,Owens,1165348,10,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.8,4.0,4.0,,"One of the harder PAM classes. She's actually nicer than she seems during lecture. What she says during class in terms of current policy reforms, data, etc. are very accurate. Doesn't conform to one political ideology. Maybe sounds like a libertarian but maybe that's because the course is focused on utilitarianism, efficiency, opp. to paternalism","Prelim means are always D- or lower (probably b/c they are graded solely by undergrad TA's and not examined by Owens), but the course has an official A median grade the past 2 semesters. Good old Ivy League inflation! Very unclear course content, misguided study materials, and ambiguous exams questions. Both Prof and TA's shockingly unhelpful.",Great class. Super interesting.

Overall, not a super tough class but a professor who means well but falls short.","Do NOT Take ILRST 2100 with Packard. Packard is a kind person, but is a terrible lecturer. He talks way too fast in lectures and he over complicates literally everything. Everyone I would talk to after class, including myself, always said they had no idea what was going on, and this is an intro stats class. Its not supposed to be this confusing.","Packard is kind and helpful prof. Read the book before class, have notes ready and listen in lecture. Never miss discussion sections since they revise and knowing Minitab really helps to check homework. Attend his office hours He helps a lot Just don't go clueless tho Try to do quiz in sections as the TA will help you. Too much work but manageable."

Final paper is unnecessarily long an a total nightmare.  professor honestly doesn't do much but is generous with iclicker points and extra credit at the end of semester.,"This isn't a terribly hard physics class, but it is definitely one you have to do a substantial amount of work for. I highly advise against participating in the play option: Hasan was all over the place during rehearsals and was consistently rude to many students. Would have been way less work to take the paper option and read a book.","This class is not as easy as everyone says it is. There aren't any tests or prelims, but it is a lot of work to do in a timely manner. Weekly chapter quizzes which can sometimes be tough if you haven't read the textbook, weekly homework (need to be done in groups), projects, and a final paper that is long.

Will miss him very much since he recently retired from teaching.,"Professor Page is one of the most supportive people in the Fine Art department at Cornell AAP. Even so, you know when he wants more from you. Take notes in his beginning lithography class since there's a lot to absorb. He will give you time and attention if you seek it. Gentle yet very excited (surprising since he's been faculty for 30+ years)","Greg is nice enough, but not very knowledgeable about issues in contemporary art.

Spends 2/5 of lecture doing 'housekeeping' related to upcoming assignments, which should have been in an e-mail or on the class site(Piazza). The next 30 minutes are filled with tangents/anecdotes, without explaining the code shown. At the end of the course, 1/3 of the enrolled students showed up. We all learned more online...",

Have taken 6 classes with him and i learn so much every single time he speaks. Very kind and understanding. I have never understood grammar like I do when he explains it. he's also just so funny sometimes? loves to talk about how English makes no sense and Russian is superior.,"Slava is approachable, accommodating, patient, friendly, fun, occasionally quite funny, and, most importantly, a great communicator, which makes for an excellent language teacher.","Slava is definitely an amazing professor. He is very enthusiastic about teaching Russian. Some things to be aware of is that the expectations are pretty high and the workload is on the heavier side, but not without its due reward.

Very nice, but doesn't understand what he's doing (and practically admits this at end of course.)","A seemingly nice person, but underneath it he can be very difficult to work with.  Young, needs more experience and more research.  Uses a system that makes you accountable for learning.  Class is very easy.  Journals are not fun!  Take it for an easy A, don't expect too much.","Nice guy, but he lacks the teaching skills to either competently cover the theories he teachers (thank goodness the assessments are a joke) or to provide proper support on the assignments he gives.

I took his poetry FWS, and while he clearly loves poetry and is knowledgeable about it, the class was rather boring. He's nice and understanding but very mild and soft-spoken.

Really approachable professor, though, who would always chat with us before class about things going on in the administration. You have to be very organized, the tests are mostly based on the readings but you get a review sheet.","Incredibly rude professor. It really felt like everything was about him and not about the students. He may be in the position of power, but it doesn't take much to treat people with a little bit of human decency.

Awesome prof!","Taught my discussion section Fall 2020 (online). He is a wonderful man and helps us so much. He grades fairly, consistently, and quickly.","iClicker questions count towards participation credit and there are several per lecture so attendance is virtually mandatory.

Extremely easy A as well, you don't have to do any readings",Most times the class feels like a waste of time if you've ever taken another soc class because the material's redundant & attendance matters. However she's very passionate & sometimes hilarious. The course packet is useless and you can do the textbook readings in class.,"Professor Pillar was one of the best professors I've had at Cornell University.

She's also boring and doesn't give practice exams or problems so you can actually prepare for the exams. You need to read the textbook if you want to learn.","She is genuinely interested in this field, as her research also revolves around biophysics. Though the interconnection of all the materials taught in the course seems a little weak, but her teaching itself is very clear. This class is very interesting if you know some bio and like working out physics."

Discussions were thought-provoking and went whatever direction the students wanted - which led to some very interesting places. She's not a professor that has a list of things to get through and that you should notice about the readings. It's all very open-ended.,"I generally dislike poetry, but overall enjoyed this FWS. Not much homework, no reading, and only four papers. Professor Pollak provides good feedback on essay drafts, outlining exactly what you should change or add. With average effort towards participation and essays, it's an easy A.","The discussions were disorganized and hard to follow, but participation counted for a huge percentage of the grade, so I felt frustrated at times. Im not sure what I was supposed to learn from the class and I would not take another one with nancy. Boring overall, and the grading was very suspicious"

He gave me a good reason to wake up each morning at 8:00!","Professor Pollock is just such a genuinely nice person who is always willing to help his students with anything. I had him for Math 1910 and he did a very decent job of explaining concepts in a way that the class would understand. Do still read the textbook though, as it is very useful for practice and refinement.","Awesome guy, always willing to help out and clearly knows his stuff, but is pretty bad at explaining things to students clearly.

Introverted, caring guy who tries his best, but the subject matter is horrifically awful. If you hate abstract theory and are turned off by group discussions during lecture, steer clear. Norman himself is fine though. Fair, accessible and reasonable.","Norman speaks in a monotone voice and seems genuinely bored by teaching.

He pushes students by offering such helpful, detailed and constructive feedback, while also making an effort to get to know his students. His kindness and energy made reading poetry a joy and unique experience.","Michael Prior is by far one of the best instructors Ive ever had at Cornell.

No laptops or screens allowed in class making it all the more boring. She makes jokes that are not at all funny and I come out of lecture feeling as if nothing she said had any meaning, just lots of words but didnt learn anything.","Regardless of your interest in the environment, I recommend everyone to take this class! It is the MOST CHALLENGING class I've taken in terms of its content. As a class cross-listed with philosophy, I was expecting some deep thinking and controversy, but this class makes you question your whole existence. It's a necessary existential crisis."

I went in expecting ridiculous homework, but it seems like Psiaki read the comments here and made his homework more manageable. The only things I didn't like was how much lab manual reading I had to do and the fact that prelim 2 was the disaster it was, with its bimodal distribution.","Lectures were well organized and clear, with good examples. Lots of material covered. High standards for the class's learning. Sometimes a bit dry presentation. ~5 hrs. of homework/week, of higher difficulty. Challenges for ex.C.

Prof. Pucci is beyond wise and will make your mind literally stretch over the couse of his class. You are going to have to be extremely dedicated to the subject matter, but Prof. Pucci is very accessible and willing to talk.

Lectures are riveting - he is the epitome of the classically ""great professor"" who engages the material in unique ways, while bringing his students along for the ride.

Unnecessary heavy workload and you will not learn anything. If you have taken a introductory CS course in high school you are overqualified for this course. and he uses outdated softwares beware of that !,"Easy class, professor is meh. Most of grade is from hw and a final project, which is nice. He literally gives all the code on his lecture slides so you can copy from them and complete the hws and final project.

His course is 7 quizzes and one final. The quizzes are all mc. Every answer is in the slides (not sure why other reviews say they are not). If a question is tricky or has bad wording, he will omit the question and give everyone credit. He truly sets the class up to be as stress-free as possible.",Professor Yang is truly a gem.

Labor & Employment Relations,298,Cornell University,Emily,,Zitek,1903952,10,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.1,4.0,4.0,,"Taken online. This class is very chill especially if you like sports. There isn't much work and the tests are easy. You don't need to read the textbook, the tests are based on the slides. There are also cool guest speakers. I would recommend this class.","Professor Zitek was great even during the online semester. I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys sports or psychology. Graded by two tests, a few short assignments, and a short group project at the end. Not a difficult class, as long as you put some time into studying you should do well!","OB is straightforward. Makes workplace scientific. Still, Zitek does a GREAT job teaching foundations AND making it interesting. Teaches up-to-date researchin an introductory course! Clear grading and evaluates in a variety of ways, so fair grading. Best, she's nice and down-to-earth. Wants students to like subject as much as she. One of my favs."
Government,298,Cornell University,Thomas,,Zittel,1403262,1,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,3.0,,,,"Relatively easy class.  Not always the most easy to understand what would be on the exam, but in the end his powerpoints were very helpful, moreso than the books.  Lecture is important since he adds much to the slides.  His German accent is easy to understand and he often makes fun of the French.",,
Architecture,298,Cornell University,Sasa,,Zivkovic,2384073,2,average,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,2.5,4.0,4.0,,Put so much into this class to receive only a B- I did what I was told and made changes to assignments to the professors liking and still had trouble. The professors were barely around in the class compared to the TAs.,SO,
Near Eastern Studies,298,Cornell University,Jeffrey,,Zorn,951234,6,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.5,5.0,5.0,,"Professor Zorn is amazing - Jerusalem the holy (arkeo/jwst 2666) is my favorite class I took at Cornell. It is definitely a challenging class, but he is so passionate about the content that it was so enjoyable. If you take diligent notes and memorize the slide IDs for the exams it won't be too difficult. 10/10 would recommend.","Professor Zorn is great! He is more than clear on what he expects our papers to contain and is a very generous grader. The subject matter is interesting and he supplements it with quirky anecdotes and archaeology jokes! I already wrote at a college level before taking this FWS, but I still find he is very good at refining subtleties in my writing.","Professor Zorn is a great human being! This class though, can yes, be boring at times. I thought we would expound upon different biblical and ancient historical facts and how they intertwine; but we mostly just write about our opinion on different subjects. Overall, it's a pretty good FWS to take."
English,298,Cornell University,Brad,,Zukovic,2090822,1,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.0,4.0,4.0,,"If you just wanna gain a S grade in FWS , this course is your best choice. Pro. Brad put the whole grading and workload pretty little and the estimated time spending per week is 5 hrs or less. But he is willing to listen to your advice and if you want to dive in deep topics, you can still talk with him in person.",,
Mathematics,298,Cornell University,David,,Zywina,2171095,11,good,TEACHER,PROFESSOR,4.6,5.0,5.0,,"Professor Zywina backs up each new theorem and concept with varied and relevant examples. He can go off on tangents when proving theorems but if you lose focus its fine as he specifies what is ""extra information"". Tests are clear and fair but they do require thorough understanding of concepts. Patient and accessible outside of class as well.",The GOAT.,The BEST! You can't bear to waste any single second in his class being distracted. Legend.
